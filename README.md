This project is about checking if someone might have heart disease by using their health details from electronic health records (EHR).
I used Python to make this, and it works by learning from past patient data. The goal is to help predict heart problems early.

The data has features like age, gender, blood pressure, chest pain type, sugar levels, and more.
I used some Python tools like:

pandas and numpy to handle the data

matplotlib and seaborn to show graphs

scikit-learn to build and test the model

I followed these steps:

Read the data from a UCI ML Repo by using ID=45

Looked at it to understand the values

Cleaned the data (checked for missing or wrong values)

Made some graphs to see patterns

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a machine learning models (Logistic regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest)

Hyper tune the model to see how well it works

This is a learning project. I made it to understand how data science and health data can work together.
Anyone who wants to try machine learning with real data can use this as a starting point.
You can run this project in Jupyter Notebook or any Python editor.
